* EasyPipeline

This library serves as an easy way to get down to any phase of the
compiler. Since this library relies on all other parts of the compiler
any code that is being written will be updated in this package, and
thus starting the =EasyPipeline= REPL should allow one to test out any
modifications they need quickly.

There will be a main file one can work off of that has every phase
imported as a qualified module.

In the future there will be modules dedicated to various parts of any
particular one pass to make life easier.
