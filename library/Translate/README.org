* Translate
This library core responsibility is from translating the [[../Frontend][Frontend]]
S-expression format into a format that [[../Core][Core]] can understand

This library undergoes regular refactors to be simpler

** Current Order of Phases

1. [[file:src/Juvix/Desugar.hs][Desugar.hs]] gets run, this runs all the current baked in.
   simplification/macro expansion passes that does not rely on looking
   up items in the context.

2. [[file:src/Juvix/Contextify.hs][Contextify.hs]] then gets run, this moves the desugared standalone
   definitions into the context.

3. Inside the same file, the =op= function gets ran, which runes the
   context aware passes.

4. We then hand off the code to [[file:src/Juvix/ToCore/FromFrontend.hs][FromFrontend.hs]] which is responsible
   for generating valid core.
   - Currently this removes the context and a lot of forms become
     unsupported at this stage of the compilation, see #754 for more
     details.

** Longer Terms Plans

- We need to move the totality of transitioning entire files down into
  taking standalone chunks which have a current Environment that is
  already built up.

- We need to move our fixed passes into generic Juvix functions that
  only macro expand.

  + Pretty much all of these forms are generic macros, with the
    exception of infix which is a reader macro which relies on the
    current context.

- We need to move the Closure functions in [[file:src/Juvix/Contextify/Environment.hs][Environment]] into more
  generic functionality for the Context closure structure.

** Interesting Files
- [[file:src/Juvix/Desugar/Passes.hs][The desugared passes themselves]]

- [[file:src/Juvix/Contextify/Passes.hs][The Context Passes]]
  + The [[file:src/Juvix/Contextify/Environment.hs][Environment]] file is also interesting as it setups the generic
    traversal the passes use.

- [[file:src/Juvix/FreeVars.hs][FreeVars]]

  + This module calculates free variables that are in any s-expression.

  + With closure functions being moved to the common closure library,
    this could be moved out.
