-- TODO âˆ· determine what has changed in the rebasing of this algo
-- - FreeVars is an algorithm that checks for free symbols in the AST.
-- - The =ExcludedSet= holds the symbols defined... These are needed
--   in case of a degenerate case like
--   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
--     let foo =
--       let type point = {x : int, y : int} in
--       let our-point  = {x = 3, y = 4} in
--       our-point.x + our-point.y
--   #+END_SRC
--   + here we need to dismiss =our-point.x= and =our-point.y=, just
--     filtering out =our-point= isn't enough! we have to check if the
--     first-part of the name has =our-point=, since everything shares
--     the same namespace
-- - TODO :: How do we handle this case?
--   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
--     mod Foo where
--
--     let foo (x :: xs) = x + TopLevel.Foo.foo xs
--     let foo []        = 0
--   #+END_SRC
--   + To Handle this, we need to unqualify the foo, and have the
--     module handle the symbol allocation
-- - NOTE :: we assume in =nameifyAdt= which takes effect in the =\\=
--   call to =nameifyLetType=, that definitions of constructors before
--   this point can't be redefined
--   + This means that if we have ordered definitions, we'll silently
--     drop the calls to the old constructors.
--   + Thus, please redefine the logic there to support such modes
-- - _Reasons to update_
--   1. let's not being recursive
--      - we assume lets are recursive, if this changes the code
--        has to be updated to account for that'
--
--   2. Language becomes ordered
--      - see first note above
--
--   3. Universe or Declaration talk about free variables
--      - currently universe is unfinished, and are not
--        first class
