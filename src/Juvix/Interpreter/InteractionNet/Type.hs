-- - Serves as the AST for all operations on [[Nets/Default]]
-- - Resembles the =BOHM= syntax/operation set, however it alters the
--   operation set quite a bit
--   + _Added_
--     1. Notion of some kind of primitive value
--     2. Curry 1-3
--        - This allows custom functions to be manifested on primitive
--          values
--   + _Removed_
--     1. =Letrec=
--        - While here, it isn't fully implemented
--     2. Hard coded math operations
--        - This has been moved to primitive value operations
