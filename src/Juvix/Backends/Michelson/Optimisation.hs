{-  This is a simple optimization strategy which replaces sequences of Michelson instructions with equivalent sequences of fewer instructions.

      At the moment nontrivial programs are unlikely to compile to the smallest equivalent Michelson instruction sequence,
    but little time has been spent on optimization so far - a high degree should be possible; the Haskell typesystem provides very strong guarantees.
      A more interesting / potentially more effective strategy might be to search the space of equivalent Michelson programs,
    which at small program sizes using bounded heuristic search should be computationally feasible -
    then choose the one with the fewest instructions (or based on some other gas-estimation preference function).
      This optimization function is typed in the Instr GADT, so it cannot produce invalid output Michelson.
    However, the typesystem does not enforce computation correctness; that would require dependent types.
