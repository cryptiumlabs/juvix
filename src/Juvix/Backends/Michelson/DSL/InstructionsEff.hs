-- - This module includes a higher level DSL which each instruction
--   has a stack effect
--   + This is similar to the base LLVM bindings we have.
--   + So for example, emitting an =add=, eats two items from the
--     virtual stack, and adds an =Instr.Add= instruction to the
--     sequence of instructions to execute
-- - For constant progoation, have a function say take-2 that looks at
--   the top two items in the stack and then returns back either if
--   they were constants or not and dispatches logic based on that
