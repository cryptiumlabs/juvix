* Architecture Choices

This directory outlines various architectural choices throughout the
code base that may seem non-obvious.

The directory thus contains the "what" and "why" of each choice that has been made.

Currently the format of this document is to have each design choice as
a self contained file in this directory.
- Later this may change as we experiment with other renders outside of
  Github's org viewer.
