* Compilation
** Michelson
[[https://michelson.org/][Michelson]] is an interpreted stack based language which runs on the Tezos
chain.

Since we are compiling to Michelson, some interesting considerations
must be made
*** Push/Enter vs Eval/Apply
Although the drawbacks of Push/Enter compared to Eval/Apply are well
known [fn:1] [fn:2], for an interpretive stack based languages, the
caveats in that statement go away.
1. _Eval/Apply is easier to compile to a normal C like language_
   - Michelson is a stack based language, this point does not apply
2. _Push/Enter spread complexity around when trying to make a fast compiler_
   - Michelson is an interpreted language, and in particular, creating
     lambdas (closures) for over evaluation is quite costly. What
     would be cheaper for this language would be to simply push the
     arguments onto the stack for the new function to consume, and
     inline said function.
*** Compilation Strategy
Currently annotated Core is translated directly into Michelson

What this means is that we map names of local variables to stack
positions. Thus, before evaluating any function, we must first
properly set the names
  + This has some serious issues in the Push/Enter model currently, as
    if we over-evaluate, then we need to know the names in which to
    compile the extra args to!
  + With careful consideration this can hopefully be solved.

This is less than ideal for more than a few reasons, and will be
changed at a future release.

However until that time, we will document what is *currently* being
done and how to improve it

One last note is that names are assumed to not be overlapping, as this
happens higher up in the compilation process
**** Virtual Stack
Currently in compiling Michelson we have what we labeled the =Virtual
Stack= (vstack), This stack could all be in the real stack or none of it could
be. What could be stored on the vstack is all the various constants,
as these would waste computation if passed around normally.

This vstack was designed so that, one could easily reason about the
stack without having to worry about “If I dup this, would it really
dup it, or just dup what is on top of the *real* stack?”

Thus primitives have to be aware of this virtual stack.
  + The alternative (map with names to constants) has this as well.
***** Debate
It is argued that a mapping from names to constants is better for this
task.

Namely, it is argued that this strategy separates our view of the stack
with the real stack.

Also, as of now, this model also has some issues, as that we often do
care about clearing the stack except for constants, and our logic does
specialize on this distinction.
  + I will note that this point is only really a temporary problem
    that will go away with a proper DSL, not the hacked out version
    that we have now.
  + This point should be reconsidered when we go forward with a nice
    DSL layer and pipeline down

Another point that should be considered is a separate layer that folds
all constants before hand
  + this requires extra work, and if we do any smart compilation like
    say compile generics functions ahead of time, this would require
    extra work, rather then just having the primitives of the language
    handle it themselves.
  + whether or not it makes sense to inline, & what can be inlined,
    may vary based on the backend & its cost model
