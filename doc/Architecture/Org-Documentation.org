* Org Documentation
Overall the code-base is documented by a mix of Markdown files and Org
files.

** Org Vs Markdown
It may seem quite odd that the code base is split between these
formats.

The decision of what format to use is up to the developer of each
documentation file/folder, and thus the choices seem rather arbitrary.

- For example, the developer of the org documentation for code found it
  quicker to hack together an org file than a markdown file.

Both Markdown and Org have good editor support and online viewers, so
for this purpose, they are at parity.

Overall, the Juvix team as a whole has no strong feelings either way
about Org Vs Markdown and thinks that there are more important questions in life.

*** Unique Benefits of Org
- in Emacs, [[https://github.com/pinard/poporg][poporg mode]] allows a developer to write comments in any
  programming language as if they were in org mode.

*** Unique Benefits of Markdown
- it renders correctly in `vim`.

** Org Mode in Code Documentation
Originally the documentation was written by hand in an org file
describing the purpose of each file as to get new contributors up to
speed on what certain modules were for. It was meant as a quick way to
view the code base and see how various modules interacted with each
other

Since =Juvix= is rapidly changing, this document quickly became out of
date and rather sparse, however a [[https://github.com/cryptiumlabs/juvix/blob/develop/scripts/generate.lisp][LISP generation file was created]] to
automatically generate these documents. Previous descriptions of the
org files were copied and pasted into the top of Haskell modules so it
would be automatically generated.

*** Why/Why not Haddock
We intend on eventually having Haddock docs along with these
informal org mode docs.

Changes to the lisp generation may be required to properly support both
styles.

** Org Mode in Architecture Choices
This was again down to choice of the original developer.
