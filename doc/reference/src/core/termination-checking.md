Idris does the obvious things (structural size decrease) + maybe a bit more.

See the [Idris paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1407/220ca09070233dca256433430d29e5321dc2.pdf) p.14 and the [original paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=360210).

[This](http://www2.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/~abel/diss.pdf) dissertation seems to cover a variety of tactics.

Also the [F* tutorial](https://www.fstar-lang.org/tutorial/), section 5 & 5.1.2, may describe a more advanced method.
