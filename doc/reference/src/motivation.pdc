Why does this matter?

- Ethereum contract losses ($xxx million). Many unexploited issues (cite 0x bug).
- Failing air traffic control systems.
- Complexity threshold in composable systems.
- Reduce cost of bringing code to production.
- Prove summaries of complex behaviours with simple predicates, reduce information asymmetry.
