Throughout this document, `typewriter font` is used for code blocks. Where possible, code blocks are syntax-highlighted.

Mathematical equations are written in the standard LaTeX style â€” they look like $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.

Definitions of new terms, functions, or properties which will be later referenced are written in a \textcolor{definitions}{\textbf{colored bold}}.

*Italic text* is used for occasional focus on important or counter-intuitive properties.
