Examples of Juvix high level language, core translation, interaction net evaluation (full pipeline).

Possible ideas (all with proofs of correctness & bounded resource consumption):

- Fungible & nonfungible token contracts
- Multi-signature contract with functional restrictions
- Social recovery: complex predicate account
- Prediction market with pluggable oracle
- Simple shielded circuit with zero-knowledge types
- Light client with proofs (ambitious, could start with PoA)
