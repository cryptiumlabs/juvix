Derivation:

- Starting thesis: humanity's resources utilized very inefficiently
  - One model: each individual gets X points to allocate to weights over possible worlds (could be weighted by their total contribution to net capability)
  - Should result in a scalar function over possible worlds, can be used to rank
- Problems
  - Gradient descent, local minima
  - No guarantee of Pareto efficiency
  - Conditional switching is hard (but easy on d-ledgers!)
