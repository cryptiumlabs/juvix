Juvix's Haskell Style Guide
===========================

This document describes the preferred coding style for Juvix.
When something isn't covered by this guide you should stay
consistent with the existing code.
See also [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cryptiumlabs/juvix/blob/develop/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md).

HLint
-----

Set up [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint)
in your code environment and follow its code suggestions
as much as you can.

General naming convention
-------------------------

For anything code related: modules, functions and variables, filenames etc. we
will use the American English spelling.

### Modules and directories

Module and directory names should be written as nouns:

```
Translation
Contextualization
Desugaring
```

We should avoid prefixes in module names as much as possible, this is what sub
directories are for, i.e. `Frontend.Contextualize` instead of
`FrontendContextualize`.

Directory names should start with a small letter, unless they match with a
module in the Haskell code:

```
library/frontend           <-- frontend is not part of the module structure.
library/frontend/src/Juvix <-- Juvix is a module.
```


### Pattern matches

When pattern matching a data constructor, using variables even for unused
fields does improve the readability of the code. To avoid numerous
`-Wunused-matches` warnings, we prefix unused variables with `_`:

```haskell
func (RawDatatype _ _ _ lvl _) = ...

func_better (RawDatatype _n _pos _a lvl _cons) = ...
```


Formatting
----------

Our formatter is [Ormolu](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu) (the latest version
on Stack). The main reason we chose Ormolu is
that it works for all the extensions we use. See this [post](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-05-27-ormolu.html)
and this [post](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-10-11-ormolu-first-release.html)
for more motivations and rationale. 

Unless otherwise specified below, follow
[Tweag's](https://github.com/tweag/guides/blob/master/style/Haskell.md) style
guide.


### Line Length

Maximum line length is *80 characters*.
There should be no trailing whitespace anywhere in your code.

- In Emacs, you can add the following code to your `init.el` file to
enforce this:

```elisp
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook (lambda () (set-fill-column 80)))
(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
             (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace t t)))
```
- In VScode, use the [Rewrap](https://github.com/stkb/Rewrap) extension to
  enable hard word wrapping.

- In Vim, follow [this](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Automatic_word_wrapping) to
  enable hard word wrapping.

### Whitespace

Surround binary operators with a single space on either side.  Use
your better judgement for the insertion of spaces around arithmetic
operators but always be consistent about whitespace on either side of
a binary operator.  Don't insert a space after a lambda.  For example:

```haskell
plus4 n = n + 4  -- whitespace on either side of `+`

(\x -> x + 4)  -- no space after the lambda
```

### Declaration comments

When adding comments as part of a declaration, we will be using the layout as
enforced by our formatter, ormolu:

```haskell
data Parameterisation primTy primVal
  = Parameterisation
      { -- | Check if a value is of a given type.
        hasType :: primVal -> PrimType primTy -> Bool,
        -- | Set of builtin types.
        builtinTypes :: Builtins primTy,
      }
```

Ormolu prefers to have `,` and `->` at the end of a line, and will rewrite any
usage of `-- ^` into `-- |`. Special care has to be taken that, if used `-- ^`,
will be at the place at the correct place. The following is incorrect, and will
not be successfully parsed by the code formatter:

```haskell
op ::
  Int -> -- ^ left hand side of operator.
  Int -> -- ^ right hand side of operator.
  Int
```

Note that the comments are not pointing to any argument, as there are placed
after the `->`. To fix this, the `->` should be placed at the beginning of the
lines, and the code formatter will correctly work.

Imports
-------

Imports should be grouped in the following order:

1. standard library imports
2. related third party imports
3. local application/library specific imports

Put a blank line between each group of imports.  The imports in each
group should be sorted alphabetically, by module name.

Always use explicit import lists or `qualified` imports for standard
and third party libraries.  The *Juvix Standard Library* is an exception.

Qualified imports help two fold:

1. easily determine what code code comes from where and refactoring dependencies
2. Enforce consistency between different Haskell modules. For example:

Before:
```haskell
module Usage where

data UsageType = ...

usage = ...

```
```haskell
module Nat where

data NatType = ...

nat = ...

```
After:

```haskell
module Usage where

data Type = ...

t = ...

```

```haskell
module Nat where

data Type = ...

t = ...

```

Exports
-------

Modules should export their datatypes and functions explicitly. The order of
the exports should preferably follow the same order as they are defined in the
file. Re-exported modules should always follow at the end, for example:

```haskell
module Mod
  ( Mod (..),
    modFunc,
    module SubMod,
  )
where
```

Typically the exports should be kept to a minimum. When exporting datatypes it
is OK to export all constructors using `(..)`.

Idioms
------

The following idioms have become standard in the code base:

- The type `T` in some module `Foo` denotes the main type of the module.
- The function `op` denotes the main functionality of a module and is stateless.
- The function `exec` denotes the main functionality of a module and is stateful.

Warnings
--------

`-Wall` is turned on. Keep warnings to the minimum.
