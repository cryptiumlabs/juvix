* Syntax Guide
This document is heavily inspired by the [[http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/reference/syntax-guide.html][Idris syntax guide]].
** File Organization
A file contains zero or more [[Top Level Declarations]]

For example
#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
  -- this is a function with a signature!
  sig foo : Natural
  let foo = 3

  -- this is a data type declaration
  type List a = Cons a (List a)
              | Nil

  -- this is a module declaration!
  mod boo =
    let fi = 10
  end
#+END_SRC
** Comments
Comments are denoted by two dashes, =--=, and it and all characters up
until the end of the line are discarded

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
  -- This is a comment!
#+END_SRC

** Expressions
*** Conditionals
**** If
If expressions have a non zero number of clauses. Each clause consists
of a boolean test, followed by a consequence.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  -- this is a valid if expression!
  if | x == 3 -> 5
     | else   -> 6
  -- ^ test      ^ consequence


  -- this is also a valid a valid if expression
  if | x == 10     -> 25
     | positive? x -> x
     | negative? x -> abs x
     | else        -> 0
#+END_SRC

The =else= name is just an alias for =False=.
